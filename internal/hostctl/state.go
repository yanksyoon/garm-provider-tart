//	delete:  deleting → gone
//	failure: any live state → failed (last_error kept, slot still held)
//
// plus two boot-reconciliation outcomes: adopted (a VM found in `tart list`
// that carries this controller's label) and quarantined (an unlabelled VM
// awaiting the quarantine TTL before it is reaped).
