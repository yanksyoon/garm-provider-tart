# Run macOS jobs with garm-provider-tart

End-to-end guide: register the template, create a pool, run a first job, plan capacity, and roll back
without orphaning VMs. Field-by-field behaviour is in
[the reference](../reference/garm-provider-tart.md); preparing the Mac minis is in
[macos-runner-host.md](macos-runner-host.md).

## Prerequisites

- A GARM controller on Linux with the `garm-provider-tart` binary installed and registered as an
  external provider (a `[[provider]]` block with `provider_type = "external"`).
- At least one Mac mini prepared by `scripts/mac/host-bootstrap.sh` and passing
  `scripts/mac/host-check.sh --json | jq -e '.ok == true'` (see
  [macos-runner-host.md](macos-runner-host.md)).
- The provider config file with one `[[hosts]]` block per Mac (see the reference).
- `garm-cli` authenticated against the controller, and the repository already registered with GARM.

Get the repository ID you will attach the pool to:

```bash
garm-cli repository list --format json | jq -r '.[] | "\(.name) \(.id)"'
```

## 1. Register the runner-install template

GARM has no darwin OS type, so the macOS runner logic lives in a template registered as `--os-type
linux`. Register it once:

```bash
garm-cli template create \
  --name macos-runner \
  --path internal/macprovider/macos-runner.sh \
  --forge-type github \
  --os-type linux
```

`scripts/mac/render-template.sh` renders the template (JIT and non-JIT) and fails if it leaks a
Linux-only mechanism; run it before registering to prove the template renders.

## 2. Create the pool

`max-runners` must not exceed the fleet capacity (hosts × `slots_per_host`). The tags list must include
`self-hosted` explicitly: GARM configures runners with `--no-default-labels`, so a missing `self-hosted`
label means no workflow ever matches.

```bash
garm-cli pool add \
  --repo <repo-id> \
  --provider-name tart \
  --image "ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-tahoe-xcode@sha256:<digest>" \
  --flavor default \
  --tags "self-hosted,macos,arm64" \
  --runner-install-template macos-runner \
  --os-arch arm64 \
  --os-type linux \
  --enabled \
  --min-idle-runners 1 \
  --max-runners 2 \
  --runner-bootstrap-timeout 900
```

Confirm the pool exists and an idle runner is being provisioned:

```bash
garm-cli pool list --format json | jq '.[] | select(.id == "<pool-id>")'
garm-cli runner list <pool-id> --format json
```

A healthy pool converges to an idle runner whose status is `running` and whose `provider_id` is
`<host>/<vm-name>`. Wait for it — clone plus boot plus readiness probe is on the order of a minute.

## 3. Run a first job

The labels must match the pool tags exactly. A minimal smoke workflow:

```yaml
name: macos-smoke
on: [push]
jobs:
  smoke:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, macos, arm64]
    steps:
      - run: uname -m
      - run: swift --version
```

The job is picked up only by runners whose label set is a superset of `runs-on`. `self-hosted` is the
GitHub-convention label GARM no longer adds for you, which is why the pool tags carry it explicitly.

## 4. Capacity planning

- Each Mac mini runs at most `slots_per_host` guests; the provider rejects a config above `2` because the
  macOS licence allows two guests per host
  ([docs/explanation/macos-runner-isolation.md](../explanation/macos-runner-isolation.md)).
- For one pool, set `--max-runners` to `hosts × slots_per_host` so GARM never asks for more than the
  fleet can hold. `--min-idle-runners` trades warm capacity for idle cost; keep it at or below
  `max-runners`.
- A single-Mac deployment is simplest as one provider and one pool per Mac with `--max-runners 2`. A
  multi-host pool needs `max-runners = hosts × 2` and lets the provider place VMs across the fleet.
- Watch `provider_metric` lines on the provider stderr (GARM logs them): `probe up= full= unknown=`,
  per-host `capacity`, and `unknown_hosts=` tell you whether you are short of slots or short of hosts.

## 5. Roll back

### Drain a host

Draining refuses new creates but leaves running VMs alone — use it before maintenance, a reboot, or
removing a host:

```bash
ssh garm@mac-mini-01 /usr/local/bin/tart-hostctl drain
```

Wait for running VMs to finish their jobs, then delete the runners:

```bash
garm-cli runner list <pool-id> --format json | jq -r '.[].name' | while read -r n; do
  garm-cli runner delete "$n"
done
```

### Delete the pool

GARM refuses to delete a pool that still has runners, so the runners go first. Deleting the pool also
drives `RemoveAllInstances`, which deletes every VM carrying this controller's ID as a safety net:

```bash
garm-cli pool delete <pool-id>
```

### Remove the provider

Remove the `[[provider]]` block from the GARM config and restart the controller. The provider itself
holds no state, so nothing on the controller needs cleaning.

### Verify no orphaned VMs

On each host, confirm the registry and Tart agree that nothing is left:

```bash
ssh garm@mac-mini-01 '/usr/local/bin/tart-hostctl status --json' | jq '.capacity'
ssh garm@mac-mini-01 'tart list --format json' | jq length
```

Both the registry `instances` and `tart list` should be empty. If a VM is unreachable and its delete
could not complete, the host-side reaper finishes it when the host returns, and the tombstone keeps the
slot counted until then — a re-image of the host (`/var/db/tart-fleet` and `~/.tart` go with the image)
is the nuclear option and is safe because GARM re-creates VMs from the pool.

## Add or replace a Mac mini

1. Bootstrap the new Mac with the same `HOST_NAME` you want in `provider_id`s
   ([macos-runner-host.md](macos-runner-host.md)), and verify it with `host-check.sh`.
2. Append its `[[hosts]]` block to the provider config (the bootstrap writes a ready-to-copy fragment
   at `/etc/garm-provider-tart.toml` on the host).
3. To replace a host: drain the old one, delete its VMs and its `[[hosts]]` block, then add the new
   block under the same name if you want provider IDs to stay stable. The registry is per host, so
   nothing else moves.
