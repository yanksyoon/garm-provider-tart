# Keep the host's golden image current: pin by digest, pull, verify, and prune
# stale caches. Never prunes VMs, and refuses to prune while a VM is running
# (the image is then in use).
#
# The provider clones VMs from the golden image. This script is the only thing
# that touches the image on the host, and it is deliberately conservative:
#   * the image is pinned by digest so a moved tag cannot silently change what
#     the fleet clones;
#   * `tart prune --entries caches` reclaims OCI/IPSW download caches only —
#     `--entries vms` is never issued (it would delete live VMs);
#   * when any VM is running, pruning is refused rather than risk reclaiming a
#     layer a live VM still depends on.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/mac/image-refresh.sh --image ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-tahoe-xcode@sha256:...
#   scripts/mac/image-refresh.sh --dry-run
#
# IMAGE may be a digest-pinned reference (preferred) or a bare tag, in which
# case `crane digest` is used to resolve the pin (CRANE, default `crane`).

Pins the golden image by digest, pulls it, verifies it appears in tart list,
